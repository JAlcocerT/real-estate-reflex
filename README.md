<!-- 
See the brd-frd.md file and lets start the  app creation with 3-step process I use when starting any new project with AI:

Build the Foundation: I feed the AI a list of requirements and ask it to generate the entire project folder tree.
Set the Rules: I get the AI to create coding_rules.mdc rules for running servers, managing ports, and basic CI/CD commands and always updating the project structure which i mentioned above.
Tech & Docs: I have the AI review the requirements, identify libraries and tech for the job, and fetch the latest documentation from context7 mcp. -->
